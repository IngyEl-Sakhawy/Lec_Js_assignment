Understanding Abstract Classes and Interfaces in JavaScript
Abstract Classes:
Definition:
In JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages, there is no explicit support for abstract classes. However, you can achieve similar behavior by using constructor functions and prototype inheritance.

Key Concepts:
Constructor Functions:

Constructor functions act as templates for creating objects. They are used to initialize object properties and methods.
Prototypal Inheritance:

JavaScript utilizes prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype object.
Abstract Methods Simulation:

To simulate abstract methods, you can throw an error in the base class method, prompting subclasses to provide their implementations.

function Shape() {
    if (new.target === Shape) {
        throw new Error("Cannot instantiate abstract class");
    }
}

Shape.prototype.draw = function () {
    throw new Error("Abstract method 'draw' must be implemented by subclasses");
};

function Circle() {
    Shape.call(this); // Call the parent constructor
}

Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle;

Circle.prototype.draw = function () {
    console.log("Drawing circle");
};

function Square() {
    Shape.call(this);
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Square.prototype.constructor = Square;

Square.prototype.draw = function () {
    console.log("Drawing square");
};


Interfaces:
Definition:
JavaScript does not have built-in support for interfaces. However, you can achieve interface-like behavior using a combination of object literals and explicit checks.

Key Concepts:
Object Literals:

Create objects with literal notation, encapsulating a set of related methods.
Explicit Implementation Checks:

Explicitly check if an object implements certain methods to mimic interface behavior.

const Animal = {
    sound: function () {
        throw new Error("Method 'sound' must be implemented");
    },
    eat: function () {
        throw new Error("Method 'eat' must be implemented");
    }
};

class Dog {
    sound() {
        console.log("Dog barks");
    }

    eat() {
        console.log("Dog eats bones");
    }
}

class Cat {
    sound() {
        console.log("Cat meows");
    }

    eat() {
        console.log("Cat eats fish");
    }
}

// Check if an object implements the Animal interface
function checkAnimalInterface(animal) {
    if (typeof animal.sound === 'function' && typeof animal.eat === 'function') {
        console.log("Object implements Animal interface");
    } else {
        console.log("Object does not implement Animal interface");
    }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
const myCat = new Cat();

checkAnimalInterface(myDog); // Output: Object implements Animal interface
checkAnimalInterface(myCat); // Output: Object implements Animal interface

Conclusion:
In JavaScript, the absence of native abstract classes and interfaces doesn't limit your 
ability to structure code effectively. While abstract classes can be simulated using constructor
functions and prototype inheritance, interfaces can be mimicked using object literals and explicit checks. 
These approaches empower developers to achieve code organization, maintainability, and polymorphism in their JavaScript applications.
